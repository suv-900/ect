            do people even respect anymore.how older am i does that really matters.
            age is nothing it doesnt represent experience,hardships,learnings.maybe.

        <p>
            crying is not worth it.strengthen yourself and clear those damn waters from
            your eyes.dont go back to your past look forward.
